# Competitor - KAI (from Kasisto)

The competitor we choose is going to be KAI banking, which is the chatbot for personal and business banking from Kasisto. As a platform, it understands banking from mundane requests to complicated tasks.

## Differences
After doing a brief research and analysis, we realize that the biggest difference between our product and theirs are the target users and their purposes. 

More specifically, our targets are restricted to Canadian government, NGOs, academia, investors, startups, etc, who tend to consult Canadian FinTech problems, while their users are more general and typically with banking issues. Besides, there is no **_single go-to source of reliable independent info about the FinTech ecosystem within Canada_** and this is exactly what we are providing, a chatbot backed up by specializing trustworthy data. 

Moreover, since we will have relatively smaller group of users, we will concentrate more on user experience upon this specific group of people who are interested in Canadian FinTech. 

As far as we are concerned, our product is better at answering Canadian FinTech Q&As as mentioned above with **_detailed, Canadian-wised, consulting-oriented clarification_** such as 'Who are the top women in FinTech in Canada?'. With the explanation provided by us, they will have excelling awareness about domestic situations and this will surely give them better judgment when making decisions on their own. While on the other hand, our competitor is more likely to be task-oriented, which just complete the user-provied tasks. If our competitor was designed to focus on this scenario, it should probably give some feedback and suggestions upon finishing the tasks or even be able to answer consulting problems on top of that.
