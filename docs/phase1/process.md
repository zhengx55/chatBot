# Running meetings
Monday meeting - IC 406

Room arrangement will be announced via Discord text channel if not enough space of the usual rooms. Note-taker for meeting rotates weekly.

Spontaneous online meetings - online meeting with preset agenda.

# Meeting preparation
Monday meeting: What we have done this week and what we’re planning to do for next week.

Online meeting: Report each member’s progress.

# Making decisions
We will have a discussion of what decisions to make. If we have different opinions, we will decide it by voting.

# Priority and/or difficulty  of user stories

As for priority, core functionalities have the highest priority for example the implementation of Crawler.

As for difficulty, depending on the how long it would take to implement and how much thinking it requires.

# Division of work
We will divide the work as even as possible, and should hold a small meeting as a group if there is a disagreement on the work division. Each of the group member should create a new branch for his own work and later makes pull request to let others merge the work after reviewing.

# Submitting work
Submit the final version of work one day before the deadline. Every group member should review the final version of work on bitbucket before the deadline.  

# Contingency planning
What if a team member drops out - Replan the distribution of the work, most likely with an online/offline meeting. Talk to prof if it doesn't get resolved easily.

What if a team member is sick for a significant period of time - Replan work distribution and keep going.

What if a team member consistently misses meetings - Call the person, deal with each case individually. Escalate to prof if needed.

What if a team member is academically dishonest - Go back to previous commit and change the offending code. Notify prof ASAP.

# Lessons to the next phase
What technology to use for indexing the keywords of the users.
